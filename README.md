# JWT Authentication Microservice
JSON Web Token Authentication using Java and Spring Boot


## About
This is an Auth Rest API, written in Spring Boot, that receives a username and password and registers the user. Authentication is then made using JWTs.

This is a real-world example of JWT Auth and is production-ready.


## API Reference (Swagger)
After you run the project locally, swagger can be found [here](http://localhost:8095/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/), if dev profile is activated.

To activate the dev profile, edit the run configuration and add the following line:
